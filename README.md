Fiyuu Assignment

Used https://github.com/thecodingmachine/react-native-boilerplate as the boilerplate to not bother with the installation of core essentials such as react-navigation, gesture-handler, reanimated etc. which are essential for this assignment.

Since I used a nicely structured, robust boilerplate... I'm expecting this to work on under any circumstances and for both ios and android provided their environments are correctly set up. 

Might wanna make sure Node version is >= 18.18 though.
